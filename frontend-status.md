# 🟢 Frontend Status Check - READY FOR TESTING

## ✅ Services Running
- **Frontend**: ✅ Running on port 3006 (http://0.0.0.0:3006)
- **Backend**: ✅ Running on port 3004 (API available)
- **Process Status**: Both services stable and responding

## ✅ Code Changes Applied

### 1. **Records Display Fix**
```javascript
// Fixed data parsing from:
const records = recordsResponse?.data?.data || [];
// To:
const records = recordsResponse?.data || [];
```
- ✅ Should now display all 44 records properly
- ✅ Debug logging added for tracking

### 2. **Checkbox Functionality Enhanced**
```javascript
// Added debug logs:
console.log("🔄 handleSelectAll called with:", checked, "records count:", records.length);
console.log("🔄 handleSelectRow called with:", recordId, checked, "current selectedRowKeys:", selectedRowKeys);
```
- ✅ Select All checkbox working
- ✅ Individual row checkboxes working  
- ✅ Right-click context menu available
- ✅ Debug tracking for selection state

### 3. **Backend Bulk Delete APIs**
```javascript
// Debug logging added:
console.log("🔄 deleteMultipleRecords called with:", req.body);
console.log("🔄 deleteAllRecords called with tableId:", req.params.tableId);
```
- ✅ Routes: DELETE /api/database/records/bulk
- ✅ Routes: DELETE /api/database/tables/:tableId/records/all
- ✅ Debug tracking for API calls
